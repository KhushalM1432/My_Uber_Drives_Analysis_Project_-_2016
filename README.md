Data Science
### 🚗 My Uber Drives Analysis Project – 2016

* Conducted **data cleaning and preprocessing** on the Uber Drives dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn**.
* Removed duplicate and missing values using custom-defined functions and imputation techniques (mean/mode filling).
* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends in ride frequency, trip categories, and customer travel patterns.
* Saved the cleaned dataset for further analysis and visualization to gain business insights about **travel behavior and ride efficiency**.
* Utilized **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for creating visual reports to support data-driven decision-making.
